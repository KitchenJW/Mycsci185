          I believe that many of societyâ€™s ills stem from broken systems which
          devalue the individual in order to maintain a machine that is outdated
          and inefficient. Our education system fails at its fundamental
          objective to educate. Our justice system fails to administer justice,
          and instead is designed to pass judgement and administer punishment.
          Our welfare system does not give people the tools they need to raise
          themselves to higher standards of living, but instead forces people to
          become dependent. These are only three of many broken systems that
          fail the people and hurt the world both socially and economically. Our
          economic system thrives on consumerism which is enormously wasteful
          and detrimental to the health of not only people but the entire
          planet. It is my hope that I can use my skills as a computer scientist
          to help create solutions and introduce fresh perspectives that have
          the potential to affect positive change in society and the world.
