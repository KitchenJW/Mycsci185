        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>We at Crazy Head Games realize that life gets crazy and sometimes makes us all feel crazy. We all struggle to deal with insecurities, depression, failure, fear, mental illness, and worse. It is our goal at Crazy Head Games to create not just games, but experiences that help our audience feel that they can recover from any obstacle and continue on to great adventures.</p><p>Our games are story driven, and deal with some topics which are difficult for many people to talk about. We hope our games will help to begin dialogue about some of these uncomfortable topics because, before a problem can be solved, we must first admit that there is a problem. It is also our hope that some experiences will lead to real-world solutions. We hope that you all can all feel like part of our Crazy Head family.</p>
