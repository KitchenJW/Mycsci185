        <p>Legacy of the Fallen is an open-world MMORPG about discovering the past and learning from it in order to
            build a better future. Players will discover that sometimes those that are called heroes are less than
            heroic, and those that are called villains are simply lost in darkness hoping for someone to show them the
            light. This is a game about how society creates monsters by first labeling them as such and then treating
            them inhumanely. Sometimes, when people expect a monster they themselves act monstrously. But, if we can see
            past our preconceived notions and choose open-mindedness, kindness, empathy, and understanding, we can
            discover a world filled with beauty, wonder and endless potential. </p>
        <p>Players will be able to create unique characters. Legacy of the Fallen allows a plethora of player choice for
            character customization. During this process, players will have the option to answer some preference
            questions that will lead to a more immersive experience and matches players with other PCs and NPCs for
            unique story arcs. Come journey with us, and you will discover wonders in Legacy of the Fallen and perhaps
            within yourself.</p>
