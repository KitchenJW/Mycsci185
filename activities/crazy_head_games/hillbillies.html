        <h1>Hillbillies</h1>
    </header>
    <p>On the surface, Hillbillies is a romp in the woods with your kin folk. However, as players dig deeper into this
        single-player or coop adventure, they will encounter a very lived-in world with some colorful and lovable
        characters. While Hillbillies takes a comical approach to some stereotypical perceptions of hill people, it also
        touches on some very real issues that affect people from varied cultures and backgrounds. Along with themes of
        tradition and legacy, Hillbillies also deals with addiction, mental illness, and abuse.The extensive dialogue
        system allows abundant player choice in how they interact with characters, and teaches that choices come with
        consequences. Players will learn communication skills and problem-solving techniques. Hillbillies also has
        elements of a management sim which gives players experience managing finances, developing organizational
        strategies, managing limited resources, and designing conservation techniques. </p>
    <p>Players can choose one of three protagonists; Bubba, a very masculine feller; Bertha, a strong feminine force to
        be reckoned with; or Jesse, a gender-neutral oddball inventor determined to bring a little technology to the
        backwoods. There will be menial tasks to complete, problems to solve, and plenty of adventures to get into. So,
        role up your sleeves and your overalls and get ready for one heck of a good time.</p>
