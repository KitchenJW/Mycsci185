    </header>
    <p>Failure is a part of life that most of us struggle to overcome. In most video games, when we fail, we get to try,
        try again. Fail Forth is not that kind of game. Fail Forth is an adventure game with puzzle elements in which
        players learn to deal with failure in positive ways. Players will learn that when they fail, they can take stock
        of their situation, pick up the pieces and move forward to some unexpected and rewarding adventures. It is our
        hope that Fail Forth will help players build confidence in their ability to not only face and overcome failure,
        but to welcome failure for its teaching potential and conquer it with style and a smile.</p>
    <p>Players will begin with a randomly generated puzzle which must be completed within an allotted time limit. If
        they succeed, they move on to the next random puzzle which will have a shorter time limit. If they fail, the
        floor collapses and they fall into darkness along with some puzzle components. They must then literally pick up
        the pieces and figure out a way to move forward. </p>
